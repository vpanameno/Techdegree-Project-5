# Techdegree-Project-5: Public API Requests

In this project, I learned how to make API requests using fetch.
I had a lot of fun (and a bit of trouble) making sure that if the modal is clicked
that the correct information is displayed. We used skills from our previous projects
and fetched from the random person generator.

I also changed the background color to blue from the original color.
